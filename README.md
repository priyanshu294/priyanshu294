### Hi, I am PRIYANSHU KUMAR

I’m a Java Backend Developer with 4 years of experience, specializing in Spring Boot, microservices, and RESTful APIs. I hold a B.Tech from Gandhi Institute for Education and Technology with an 8.2 CGPA and have a 5-star Java rating on HackerRank. My passion lies in building scalable backend systems and writing clean, efficient code.

At Accenture, I’ve worked on enterprise projects in Retail and Life Sciences, notably with clients like Qurate Retail and AstraZeneca. I’ve led API development, enhanced microservice integrations, and maintained high test coverage with JUnit and Mockito. My work also involved AWS services, CI/CD pipelines, and Agile practices.

Going forward, I aim to grow into a backend architecture role and contribute to high-impact, cloud-native solutions. I’m always eager to learn, take ownership, and drive innovation in dynamic tech environments.
